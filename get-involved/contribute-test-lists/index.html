<h1 id="contributing-to-test-lists:fec1bdee7ae1ffe67049b3dd79aa51e3">Contributing to Test Lists</h1>

<p>Censorship findings are only as interesting as the sites and services that you test.</p>

<p>We encourage you to suggest sites and services to test for censorship.</p>

<p>Please read the documentation below to contribute to community resources for censorship measurement research.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-test-lists:fec1bdee7ae1ffe67049b3dd79aa51e3">What are test lists?</h2>

<p>Test lists are lists that include URLs that are tested for censorship.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/">Citizen Lab</a> supports OONI and other censorship measurement projects with a public resource that includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/global.csv">Global test list</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists">Country-specific test lists</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The global list includes a wide range of internationally relevant websites, most of which are in English.</p>

<p>Each country-specific test list includes
websites that are relevant and commonly accessed within that country, many of
which are in local languages.</p>

<p>The URLs included in these lists fall under <strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">30
categories</a></strong>, ranging from news media, file sharing and
culture, to provocative or objectionable categories, like pornography, political criticism and hate speech.</p>

<h2 id="why-contribute-to-test-lists:fec1bdee7ae1ffe67049b3dd79aa51e3">Why contribute to test lists?</h2>

<p><strong>1. You can provide local expertise</strong></p>

<p>Examining internet censorship in a country requires local expertise, an understanding of:</p>

<ul>
<li>which sites and services are commonly accessed;</li>
<li>which sites and services are more likely to be blocked;</li>
<li>which sites and services would be interesting to test in light of the country&rsquo;s social and political environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure that test lists include a variety of different types of URLs that are updated on an ongoing basis, we need community contributions from around the world.</p>

<p><strong>2. Potential risks</strong></p>

<p>When running ooniprobe, you will connect to and download data from the websites
included in the global test list and in the test list which is specific to the
country that you are running ooniprobe from.</p>

<p>We therefore encourage you to review all of the URLs included in these lists carefully, prior to running ooniprobe, as connecting to some of these websites might be legally questionable (or illegal) in some jurisdictions.</p>

<p>If you are uncertain of the potential implications of connecting to and
downloading data from the websites listed in the test lists, you can pass your
<em>own</em> test list with the following type of command line option:</p>

<p><code>ooniprobe &lt;test-name&gt; -f &lt;your-test-list&gt;</code></p>

<h2 id="contributing-to-test-lists-1:fec1bdee7ae1ffe67049b3dd79aa51e3">Contributing to test lists</h2>

<p>You can contribute to test lists in 2 ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Review <em>existing</em> test lists;</p></li>

<li><p>Create <em>new</em> test lists for countries that don&rsquo;t have test lists yet.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reviewing-test-lists:fec1bdee7ae1ffe67049b3dd79aa51e3">Reviewing test lists</h3>

<p>All test lists that ooniprobe is designed to test for censorship are hosted in
the <a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists">Citizen Lab&rsquo;s test-list repository on github</a>.</p>

<p>To review country-specific test lists, please follow the steps below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Find the <em>csv</em> file which is specific to the country that you want
to run ooniprobe from (based on that country&rsquo;s code)
<strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t find a csv file for your country, that&rsquo;s probably because it
doesn&rsquo;t exist yet. In this case, please refer to the next section on <em>&ldquo;Creating new test lists&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Add <em>new</em> URLs to the csv file under the &ldquo;url&rdquo; column.</p>

<p>Some criteria for adding new URLs can include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The URLs cover topics of socio-political interest within the country;</p></li>

<li><p>The URLs are likely to be blocked because they include sensitive content (for
example, they touch upon sensitive issues or express political criticism);</p></li>

<li><p>The URLs have been blocked in the past;</p></li>

<li><p>You have faced difficulty connecting to those URLs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For further criteria, please view the URL categories
<strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Please try to add URLs which fall under as many (if not all) of these categories as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Every time you add a URL, please add the following in the csv file for
  each new URL:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Category code:</strong> Add the code of the category that each URL falls under.
This can be added under the &ldquo;category_code&rdquo; column of the csv file. The
category codes can be found <strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">here</a></strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Category description:</strong> Add the description of the category that each URL
falls under. This can be added under the &ldquo;category_description&rdquo; column of
the csv file. The category descriptions can be found
<strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">here</a></strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Date:</strong> Add the date of when you added each URL. This can be added under the
&ldquo;date_added&rdquo; column of the csv file.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> <em>Optional:</em> Add the name of the organization that you are
affiliated with, in terms of contributing to the test list. This can be
added under the &ldquo;source&rdquo; column of the csv file.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>Optional:</em> Here you can add notes for each URL under the &ldquo;notes&rdquo;
column of the csv file.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Change the category codes and descriptions for URLs (included under
the &ldquo;category_code&rdquo; and &ldquo;category_description&rdquo; columns of the csv file) <em>only
if</em> you think that those URLs have been allocated to wrong category codes and
descriptions. In this case, please replace the category codes and descriptions
with ones (from the <a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">recommended categories</a> that you think are more
suitable. We would also appreciate a comment on
<a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists">github</a> or via email explaining the
proposed changes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once you have reviewed a test list based on the above, please submit
 your changes to us. If you&rsquo;re a github user, you can do so through a pull
 request. If you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> a github user, please send us a <em>spreadsheet</em>
 (including the same format as github csv files) by dropping us an email at
 contact@openobservatory.org (PGP Key Fingerprint: 4C15 DDA9 96C6 C0CF 48BD
 3309 6B29 43F0 0CB1 77B7).</p>

<h3 id="creating-new-test-lists:fec1bdee7ae1ffe67049b3dd79aa51e3">Creating new test lists</h3>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t find a test list specific to your country
<a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/tree/master/lists">here</a>, then it
probably does not exist yet. Please help us create a test list for your country
through the steps below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Create a csv file and name it based on an ISO-3166 two-letter country
code which is specific to the country that URLs are being added for. You can
find a reference for international standards for country codes
<strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-country_codes.csv">here</a></strong>. An example would include a csv file created for Andora, named <em>ad.csv</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Include the following columns in the newly created csv file:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>url</p></li>

<li><p>category_code</p></li>

<li><p>category_description</p></li>

<li><p>date_added</p></li>

<li><p>source</p></li>

<li><p>notes</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Add URLs under the &ldquo;url&rdquo; column of the csv file.</p>

<p>Some criteria for adding new URLs can include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The URLs cover topics of socio-political interest within the country;</p></li>

<li><p>The URLs are likely to be blocked because they include sensitive content (for
example, they touch upon sensitive issues or express political criticism);</p></li>

<li><p>The URLs have been blocked in the past;</p></li>

<li><p>You have faced difficulty connecting to those URLs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For further criteria, please view URL categories
<strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Every time you add a URL, please add the following in the csv file for
 each new URL:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Category code:</strong> Add the code of the category that each URL falls under.
This can be added under the &ldquo;category_code&rdquo; column of the csv file. The
category codes can be found <strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">here</a></strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Category description:</strong> Add the description of the category that each URL
falls under. This can be added under the &ldquo;category_description&rdquo; column of
the csv file. The category descriptions can be found
<strong><a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">here</a></strong>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Date:</strong> Add the date of when you added each URL. This can be added under the
&ldquo;date_added&rdquo; column of the csv file.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Contributor:</strong> <em>Optional:</em> Add the name of the organization that you are
affiliated with, in terms of contributing to the test list. This can be
added under the &ldquo;source&rdquo; column of the csv file.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Notes:</strong> <em>Optional:</em> Here you can add notes for each URL under the &ldquo;notes&rdquo;
column of the csv file.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once you have created a new test list based on the above, please
 submit your csv file to us. If you&rsquo;re a github user, you can do so through a
 pull request. If you&rsquo;re <em>not</em> a github user, please send us your csv file by
 dropping us an email at contact@openobservatory.org (PGP Key Fingerprint: 4C15
 DDA9 96C6 C0CF 48BD  3309 6B29 43F0 0CB1 77B7).</p>

<p>## Important tips</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Always include the full URL, including the HTTP or HTTPS prefix, exactly as it appears when you type it into a browser.</strong> If you include <code>example.com</code> in a test list, ooniprobe won&rsquo;t be able to test it. Rather, it should be included as <code>http://www.example.com</code>, if that is what it looks like in a browser.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Always use the format described in the sections above.</strong> The test lists are meant to be machine-readable, and ooniprobe will not parse test lists that don&rsquo;t strictly follow the prescribed format.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Please stick to the categories included <a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">here</a>, and refrain from adding your own categories.</strong> The categories may not be perfect, and we welcome your suggestions for additional/alternative categories. But if you don&rsquo;t use the prescribed category codes, ooniprobe will not be able to test those URLs, since test lists are meant to be machine-readable.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Please do not scrape and add &ldquo;the top 1,000 Alexa sites&rdquo;.</strong> Community contributions are more useful when they include URLs that (a) fall under these <a href="https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists/blob/master/lists/00-LEGEND-new_category_codes.csv">30 diverse categories</a> and (b) reflect local insight. Given that many ooniprobe users around the world have bandwidth constraints, we favour <em>quality</em> over quantity in terms of what is tested.</p></li>
